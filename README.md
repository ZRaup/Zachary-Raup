### About Me
Welcome to my data science portfolio. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Kutztown University with a bachelor's degree in Physics, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for data-driven exploration. Throughout my academic journey, I specialized in data analysis and modeling, particularly in the realms of exoplanets and binary stars. This experience not only deepened my understanding of complex datasets but also honed my skills in extracting meaningful insights.

Professionally, I have developed robust capabilities in Python for data analysis, leveraging techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and statistical modeling. I am proficient in SQL querying, adept at managing and extracting insights from large datasets to support data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I possess advanced skills in data visualization using Tableau and Power BI, creating insightful visualizations that effectively communicate findings and support strategic initiatives.

I am dedicated to applying my expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to solve challenging problems and contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth in the dynamic field of data science.

##### Below is a select list of data and coding projects that I have completed.  
&nbsp;  
### [Project 1:](TOI4153_port.md)    
## [Utilizing MCMC in Python to Explore the Parameter Space of an Exoplanet Transit](TOI4153_port.md)  

#### Project Overview
This research project focuses on modeling the transit of exoplanets across stars using the Python package 'batman'. The objective was to accurately predict changes in stellar brightness during these transits, validated against photometry data from the CR Chambliss Astronomical Observatory (CRCAO). Methodologically, a physics-based model was developed and evaluated using a log likelihood function to fit observational data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, facilitated by 'emcee', enabled exploration of parameter uncertainties such as planet radius and transit timing. Visualizations created with matplotlib included light curves, histograms of parameter distributions, and a corner plot illustrating parameter correlations. Presenting findings at the 241st AAS meeting highlighted contributions to understanding exoplanet transit dynamics, crucial for advancing knowledge of planetary systems beyond our solar system.

###### Skills Applied: Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, emcee, & batman), Jupyter Notebook, and Excel

The parameters of the model were determined using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and known parameters taken from the [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/target.php?id=470171739) database.

### [Project 2:](MySQL_port.md)   
## [Insights into Dog Behavior: Analyzing Dognition Data with MySQL](MySQL_port.md)  

#### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to utilize MySQL queries to perform analysis of trends and relationships embedded within the Dognition database. Developed as a fundamental component of the ‘Managing Big Data with MySQL’ course from Duke University, the project focuses on refining and applying skills in data cleaning, sorting, and employing advanced analytical techniques using SQL. By exploring large datasets such as the Dognition database, the project aims to uncover meaningful insights into canine behavior patterns and preferences, leveraging robust data management practices to extract actionable intelligence for further research and practical applications in understanding and enhancing dog-human interactions.

###### Skills Applied: MySQL, Writing Queries, Relational Databases, and Big Data  

#### Image 2: Top States by Number of Dognition Users
##### This MySQL query analyzes geographical user trends within the Dognition dataset, resulting in a table that lists the top 5 states with the highest number of Dognition users.
