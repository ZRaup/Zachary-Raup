## [Discovering Similar Songs Using Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning with Spotify Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zacharyraup/discovering-similar-songs-using-machine-learning-a)  

#### Project Overview
This project explores the use of unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze and visualize the similarity between songs based on audio characteristics available from Spotify. By applying preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced techniques like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), I created an interactive, interpretable map of songs, with a focus on comparing all tracks to "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd.

###### Skills Applied: Unsupervised Machine Learning, Python (scikit-learn), Cosine Similarity, NMF, t-SNE and more 

#### Image 1: t-SNE Projection of Spotify Tracks Based on Audio Features
##### This visualization displays a two-dimensional t-SNE projection of over 6,000 songs from Spotify, where each point represents a song and is colored by its cosine similarity to "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd. Audio features were normalized and reduced using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) before applying t-SNE. Shapes indicate song relevance: circles for general tracks, a diamond for the reference song, and squares for the top 10 most similar tracks. The color gradient highlights how closely a song matches the reference based on key musical characteristics.

## [Walmart Sales Prediction | Regression Modeling](Walmart_Sales_Prediction.md)  

#### Project Overview
Accurate weekly sales predictions are essential for retail businesses to manage inventory, forecast demand, and optimize profitability. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict weekly sales for Walmart stores based on historical data spanning 2010 to 2012. Various regression models, including Random Forest, Boosted Trees, and Ridge Regression, were applied and compared to identify the most reliable approach for capturing complex data relationships and improving predictive accuracy.

###### Skills Applied: Machine Learning, Python (scikit-learn), Regression Modeling, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering and more 

#### Image 2: Average Weekly Sales by Store and Regression Model Performance
##### The first chart visualizes the average weekly sales across all stores, revealing that stores like Store 4 and Store 20 consistently outperform others in sales volume, while stores such as Store 33 report the lowest averages. The second chart ranks the performance of various regression models based on RMSE. Random Forest Regression stands out with the lowest RMSE (107,130.99) and highest R¬≤ score (0.9636), demonstrating strong predictive accuracy. Decision Tree and Boosted Tree models also show solid performance, whereas linear and neural network models lag behind, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble methods for this task.

## [Predicting Diabetes Using Machine Learning | Comparison of Classification Models](PDML.md)  

#### Project Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of five machine learning models‚ÄîLogistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)‚Äîin predicting diabetes status using a cleaned patient dataset. By employing cross-validation and assessing key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, the analysis highlights the importance of selecting a model that balances these metrics for reliable healthcare applications. A model with high accuracy and recall is crucial for effectively identifying diabetic patients, thereby minimizing the risks associated with missed diagnoses.

## [Utilizing MCMC to Explore the Parameter Space of an Exoplanet Transit](TOI4153_port.md)  

#### Project Overview
This research project focuses on modeling the transit of exoplanets across stars using the Python package 'batman'. The objective was to accurately predict changes in stellar brightness during these transits, validated against photometry data from the CR Chambliss Astronomical Observatory (CRCAO). Methodologically, a physics-based model was developed and evaluated using a log likelihood function to fit observational data. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, facilitated by 'emcee', enabled exploration of parameter uncertainties such as planet radius and transit timing. Visualizations created with matplotlib included light curves, histograms of parameter distributions, and a corner plot illustrating parameter correlations. Presenting findings at the 241st AAS meeting highlighted contributions to understanding exoplanet transit dynamics, crucial for advancing knowledge of planetary systems beyond our solar system.

###### Skills Applied: Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, emcee, & batman), Jupyter Notebook, and Excel  

#### Image 4: TOI-4153 modeled lightcurve
