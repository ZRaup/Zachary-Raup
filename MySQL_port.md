#### About the Data Set: Dognition

Dognition is a company that offers interactive tests designed for users to engage with their dogs. These tests are intended to create a personalized profile of the dog's personality based on collected data and information about the dog's background. The company uses this data to provide insights into various aspects of a dog's behavior and preferences.

The Dognition dataset encompasses a comprehensive range of information across six tables, featuring over 30 columns and exceeding 100,000 rows of data. This dataset includes details about users, such as their demographics and geographical information. It also captures specific attributes related to dogs, such as breed, age, and size. Additionally, the dataset covers information about the tests conducted and the corresponding results, offering a rich source of information for analyzing behavioral patterns and preferences in dogs.

By leveraging this dataset, Dognition aims to enhance knowledge of canine behavior, helping dog owners discover activities and interests that their dogs may excel in or enjoy. This data-driven approach not only supports personalized recommendations but also contributes to broader comprehension into pet behavior and psychology.

## Writing Queries to Analyze the Data:



### Test Completion Trends

#### Cleaning and Analyzing Data: Number of Tests Completed per Day of the Week
This query calculates the count of tests completed by distinct users with their dogs on each weekday across multiple years within the Dognition dataset. The dataset is filtered to include only users located in the contiguous United States (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) and excludes entries marked with "1" in their exclude columns to eliminate non-user testing inputs. The results are sorted first by year in ascending order and then by the total number of tests completed in descending order. The query utilizes a join function between the 'dogs' and 'users' tables to combine data from the complete_tests table (c) with a refined subset of dog and user data (dogs_cleaned). This ensures that the analysis focuses exclusively on tests associated with dogs owned by users meeting the specified geographical and exclusion criteria.




```sql
%%sql
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at) AS dayasnum, YEAR(c.created_at) AS year,
COUNT(c.created_at) AS numtests,
(CASE
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=1 THEN "Su"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=2 THEN "Mo"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=3 THEN "Tu"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=4 THEN "We"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=5 THEN "Th"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=6 THEN "Fr"
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(c.created_at)=7 THEN "Sa"
END) AS daylabel
FROM complete_tests c JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT dog_guid
    FROM dogs d JOIN users u
        ON d.user_guid=u.user_guid
    WHERE ((u.exclude IS NULL OR u.exclude=0)
        AND u.country="US"
        AND (u.state!="HI" AND u.state!="AK")
        AND (d.exclude IS NULL OR d.exclude=0))) AS dogs_cleaned
    ON c.dog_guid=dogs_cleaned.dog_guid
GROUP BY year,daylabel
ORDER BY year ASC, numtests DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Geographic User Participation Trends

#### Cleaning and Analyzing Data: Number of Distinct Users by State

This query calculates the number of distinct users who have completed tests with their dogs, segmented by state within the Dognition dataset. The dataset is filtered to include only users located in the contiguous United States (excluding Hawaii and Alaska) and excludes entries marked with "1" in their exclude columns to remove non-user inputs. The results are sorted by the total number of distinct users in descending order. The query joins the 'dogs' and 'users' tables to combine data from the complete_tests table (c) with a refined subset of dog and user data (dogs_cleaned). This ensures the analysis focuses exclusively on tests associated with dogs owned by users who meet the specified geographical and exclusion criteria.


```sql
%%sql
SELECT dogs_cleaned.state AS state, COUNT(DISTINCT dogs_cleaned.user_guid) AS
numusers
FROM complete_tests c JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT dog_guid, u.user_guid, u.state
    FROM dogs d JOIN users u
        ON d.user_guid=u.user_guid
    WHERE ((u.exclude IS NULL OR u.exclude=0)
        AND u.country="US"
        AND (d.exclude IS NULL OR d.exclude=0))) AS dogs_cleaned
    ON c.dog_guid=dogs_cleaned.dog_guid
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY numusers DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

     * mysql://studentuser:***@localhost/dognitiondb
    5 rows affected.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>state</th>

### Test Completion Duration Trends

#### Cleaning and Analyzing Data: Average Test Complettion Time per Breed Type

This query calculates the average completion time and standard deviation for each dog breed across all tests using data from the exam_answers table in the Dognition dataset. Negative durations are excluded from the analysis. The results are categorized by breed type and are derived through a join between the dogs and exam_answers tables to aggregate the necessary data.


```sql
%%sql
SELECT d.breed_type AS breed_type,
AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,e.start_time,e.end_time)) AS AvgDuration,
STDDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,e.start_time,e.end_time)) AS StdDevDuration
FROM dogs d JOIN exam_answers e
    ON d.dog_guid=e.dog_guid
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,e.start_time,e.end_time)>0
GROUP BY breed_type;
```

     * mysql://studentuser:***@localhost/dognitiondb
    4 rows affected.
    




<table>
    <tr>
        <th>breed_type</th>
        <th>AvgDuration</th>
        <th>StdDevDuration</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cross Breed</td>
        <td>11810.3230</td>
        <td>59113.45580229881</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
